# fan-page
This was the very first HTML project I made as a Tech Elevator student. Our assignment was to create a one-page fan website devoted to something we love (a character, show, movie, book, etc). I made my fan page about the television show The Office.

This page is very basic, but it's fun to look back on where I started compared to what I know now!
